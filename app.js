// ALAB 308H.5.4 - JavaScript Total Recall


// A. Q + A:
    // 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? A: with the assignemnt operator.
    // 2. How do we change the value of a variable? A: with the "==" equal to operator.
    // 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable? A: with the "==" equal to operator.
    // 4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define? A: Declare - to create a variable but not necessarily provide a value for it, Assign - giving a value to a declared variable. Define - declaration with a value.
    // 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it? A: basic, instructions to plan what code should do. it can allow for solving in a structured way breaking down the problem into more manageable subcomponents.
    // 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it? A: depending on complexity, 80/20 rule often applies: 80% planing, 20% coding.


// B. Strings:
    // Create a variable called firstVariable.
    // Assign it the value of the string "Hello World".
    // Change the value of this variable to some number.
    // Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable.
    // Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
    // What is the value of firstVariable? A: the "some number" previously assigned: 7.

    let firstVariable;
    firstVariable = "Hello World";
    firstVariable = 7;
    let secondVariable = firstVariable;
    secondVariable = "any string";

    console.log(firstVariable);

   
    // Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
  
    let yourName = "Justin G";
    newString = "Hello, my name is " + yourName;


// C. Booleans

    const a = 4;
    const b = 53;
    const c = 57;
    const d = 16;
    const e = 'Kevin';

    console.log(a != b);
    console.log(c > d);
    console.log('Name' == 'Name');
    // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
    console.log(true || false);
    console.log(false || false || false || false || false || true);
    console.log(false == false)
    console.log(e == 'Kevin');
    console.log(a + b == c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
    console.log(a * a == d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
    console.log(48 == '48');


// D. The Farm

    // Declare a variable animal. Set it to be "cow" or some other animal.
    // Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the variable is equal to cow.
    // Change your code so that if the variable animal is anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."


    let animal = "cat"; 

    if (animal == "cow") {
        console.log("mooooo");
        } else {
        console.log("Hey! You're not a cow.");
    }



// E. Driver's Ed
    
    // Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic.
    // Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!" if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."
  
    const minimumAge = 16;
    let driverAge = 15;

    if (driverAge >= minimumAge) {
        console.log("Here are the keys!");
        } else {
            console.log("Sorry, you're too young.");
        }


// II. Loops

    // A. The Basics

    // Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive.
    // Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400.
    // Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000.

    
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
    
    for (let i = 10; i <= 400; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    }

    for (let i = 12; i <= 4000; i += 3) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    

    // B. Get Even
    
    // Print out the numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100.
    // Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number"
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(i + ' <-- is an even number');
    } else {
        console.log(i);
        }
    }


    // C. Give Me Five

    // For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a <number>. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five.
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("I found a " + i + ". High five! Three is a crowd.");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            console.log("I found a " + i + ". Three is a crowd.");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("I found a " + i + ". High five!");
        } else {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }


    // D. Savings Account
    
    // Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called bank_account.
    // Check your work! Your bank_account should have $55 in it.

    // You got a bonus! Your pay is now doubled each week. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 100 multiplied by 2.
    // Check your work! Your bank_account should have $10,100 in it.

        

    let bank_account = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        bank_account += i * 2;
    }

    console.log(bank_account);



// III. Arrays & Control flow

    // A. Talk About It

    // What are the things in an array called? A: elements.
    // Do Arrays guarantee those things will be in order? A: no.
    // What real-life thing could you model with an array? A: student roster (name, age, grade, etc).

    // B. Easy Does It

    // Create an array that contains three quotes and store it in a variable called quotes.
    let quotes = ["i think therefore i am", "it's not over till it's over", "better to be safe than sorry"];

    // C. Accessing Elements

    // Given the following array, const randomThings = [1, 10, "Hello", true]:
    // How do you access the 1st element in the array? A: randomThings[0]
    // What would you write to access the 3rd element of the array? A: randomThings[2];

    // D. Change Values

    // Given the following array, const ourClass = ["Salty", "Zoom", "Sardine", "Slack", "Github"]:
    // Change the value of "Github" to "Octocat".
    // Add a new element, "Cloud City" to the array.
    // Check the value of the array to make sure it updated the array.

    const ourClass = ["Salty", "Zoom", "Sardine", "Slack", "Github"];

    ourClass[4] = "Octocat";
    ourClass.push("Cloud City");
    
    console.log(ourClass);


    // E. Mix It Up

    // Note: You don't really need .splice() for these. You could use it, but there are simpler array methods that are more appropriate.
    // Given the following array, const myArray = [5, 10, 500, 20]:
    // Add the string "Aegon" to the end of the array. Add another string of your choice to the end of the array.
    // Remove the 5 from the beginning of the array.
    // Add the string "Bob Marley" to the beginning of the array.
    // Remove the string of your choice from the end of the array.
    // Reverse this array using Array.prototype.reverse().

    // Did you mutate the array? What does mutate mean? Did the .reverse() method return anything? A: yes I did mutate the array. mutate means to change. .reverse() does not return any value it just alters the original array.


    let myArray = [5, 10, 500, 20];

    myArray.push("Aegon");
    myArray.push("Coffee");
    myArray.shift();
    myArray.unshift("Bob Marley");

    console.log(myArray);

    // remove "Aegon" by filtering
    myArray = myArray.filter(item => item !== "Aegon");
    myArray.reverse();
    console.log(myArray);


    // F. Biggie Smalls

    // Create a variable that contains an integer.
    // Write an if ... else statement that:
    // console.log()s "little number" if the number is entered is less than 100.
    // console.log()s "big number" if the number is greater than or equal to 100.


    let myNumber = 7;

    if (myNumber < 100) {
        console.log("little number");
        } else if (myNumber >= 100) {
            console.log("big number");
    }


    // G. Monkey in the Middle

    // Write an if ... else statement:
    // console.log() little number if the number entered is less than 5.
    // If the number entered is more than 10, log "big number".
    // Otherwise, log "monkey".

    let myNum = 7;
    
    if (myNum < 5) {
        console.log("little number");
        } else if (myNum > 10) {
            console.log("big number");
        } else {
            console.log("monkey");

    // Make the user's name uppercase.

    // The function does not need a return statement, it will merely modify the user object.
    // Write a function oldAndLoud that performs the exact same tasks as updateUser, but instead of hard-coding it to only work on our user object, make it take a parameter person, and have it modify the object that is passed in as an argument when the function is called. Call your oldAndLoud function with user as the argument.
